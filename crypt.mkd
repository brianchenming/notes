# Threats in Networking communications
## Disclosure
## Traffic analysis
Discovery of the pattern of traffic between parties.
## Masquerade
Insertion of messages into the network from a fraudulent source.

## Content modification
## Sequence modification
Any modification to a sequence of messages between parties, including
insertion, deletion, and reordering.
## Timeing modification
Delay or replay of messages
## Repudiation
Denial of receipt of message by destination or denial of transmission of
message by source.

# Authentication
## Authenticator
Three categories of techniques for generating Authenticator:
1. Message encryption (need way to differentiate plantext and noise)
2. Message authentication code (MAC)
	- unlike encryption, it does note have to be reversible
	- allow authentication to be performed on a seletive basis (flexible)
	- separation of authentication and confidentiality affords flexibility
3. Hash function (do have a key as encryption and MAC)

# What is cryptography
- A tremendous tool
- The basis for many security mechanisms
NOT
- The solution to all security problems
- Reliable unless implemented and used properly
- Something you should try to invent yourself

# Crypto magic applications
- Digital Signature
- Anonymous communication
- Anonymous digital cash
1. Can I spend a “digital coin” without anyone knowing who I am?
2. How to prevent double spending?
- Election and private auction (w/o disclose private information)
- Privately outsourcing computation
  eg, as Google to search stuff w/o telling it the keywords
- Zero knowledge (proof of knowledge)

# Rigorous science
1. Threat model
2. Propose a construction
3. Prove that breaking construction under threat model will solve an underlying
hard problem

# Cryptography history
## Caesar Cipher is NOT a cipher because it does not have a key

## Substitution Encryption can be broke using frequency attack
Use frequency of letter, bigram, trigram etc.

## Vigener cipher
- Add key with the plaintext.
- Can also be broke using frequency attack by trying different key length.

## Rotor machines (1870 - 1943)

## Data Encryption Standard (1974)
key length is 56 (too small), and block size is 64 bits

## Advanced Encryption Standard (2001)
128-bit key

# Discrete Probability
## Universe U is a finite set U = {0, 1}^n
## Probability distribution P over U is a function P: U -> [0, 1]
## Distribution vector (P(000), P(001), ..., P(111))
## A subset $A \subseteq U$ is called an event
## union bound $Pr[A \cup B] \le Pr[A] + Pr[B]$
## A random variable X is a function X: U -> V. Take value in some set V.
## random variables X, Y taking values in V are independent if:
for $\all a, b \in V, Pr[A=a and B=b] = Pr[A=a] Pr[B=b]$

## An important property of XOR
The XOR of an arbitrary random variables and an independent uniform random
variable, will be a uniform variable.

## The birthday paradox
With n iid. random variable, if sampled $\sqrt{U}$, then 
  Pr[two variables take the same value] > 1/2
