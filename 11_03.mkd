script and scriptreplay: record terminal sessions.

    $ script -t 2> timing.log -a output.session
    type commands;

find: 

    $ find . \( -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.pdf" \) -print
    ./text.pdf
    ./new.txt
    $ find /home/users -path "*slynux*" -print
    /home/users/list/slynux.txt
    /home/users/slynux/eg.css
    $ find . -iregex ".*\(\.py\|\.sh\)$"

    $ find . ! -name "*.txt" -print

    ./new.PY
    $ find . -type f -user root -exec chown slynux {} \;

xargs:

    $ cat cecho.sh
    #!/bin/bash -
    echo "$@ #"
    $ echo "arg1 arg2 arg3" | xargs -n 2 ./cecho.sh
    arg1 arg2 #

    -p arg1 -l #
    -p arg2 -l #
    -p arg3 -l #

Hence we must use -print0 along with find to produce an output with delimited
character null ('\0') whenever we use the find output as the xargs input.

    $ find . -type f -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
