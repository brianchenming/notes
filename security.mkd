# Malleability
Malleability is a property of some cryptographic algorithms.An encryption
algorithm is malleable if it is possible for an adversary to transform a
ciphertext into another ciphertext which decrypts to a related plaintext. That
is, given an encryption of a plaintext $m$, it is possible to generate another
ciphertext which decrypts to $f(m)$, for a known function $f$, without
necessarily knowing or learning $m$.
