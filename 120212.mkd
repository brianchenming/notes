# Linux
Obviously, we strongly suggest you to recompile your kernel, so that you can
enable a number of useful debugging features, such as forced module unloading
(MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD): when this option is enabled, you can force the kernel to
                       unload a module even when it believes it is unsafe, via a
                       rmmod -f module command.
