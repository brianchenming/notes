A *dollop* of romance now and then is good for everybody.

One showed her wearing sunglasses and leaning on the hood of a white Maserati.
Another revealed her closetful of HermÃ¨s handbags. Yet a third showed her
sipping a drink in a business-class cabin on an airline flight. None of it was
outrageous by the standards of China's *nouveau riche*. 

At the same time, she posted photos and entries detailing her jet-set life,
   writing of the orange Lamborghini she drove in the south and the white
   Maserati she had in Beijing . 

*Paparazzi*-style photographs showed her arriving in the Beijing airport on June
27 from Shenzhen, where she also lives, and rushing off in a private *sedan*.
