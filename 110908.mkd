# OS
static functions are functions that are only visable to other functions in the
same file.

# gdb
From a GDB session, type:

    (gdb) display /i $pc
    (gdb) break main

The first line will tell GCC to output the assembly code. The second one will
create a breakpoint on the main function

Tell gdb to use a narrower display width than usual.

    (gdb) set width 70
