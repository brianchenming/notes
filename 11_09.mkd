# OS
Twoâ€™s complement: In general, to extend an unsigned number, one makes all the
new bits of the expanded number 0.

x86 Real mode (state at boot; 20-bit address, no virtual memory; no paging)

x86 Protected mode (VM, segmentation and paging)

x86 Long mode

Ring 0: os operation mode

cr3 (control register 3) point to current paging table

Page flags: 3 bits for OS to use

TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) is not coherent with memory (tlb_invalidate)

To paraphrase Parkinson's law, "Programs expand to fill the memory available to
hold them."
# English
A *leap of faith*, in its most commonly used meaning, is the act of believing in
or accepting something intangible or unprovable, or without empirical evidence.

His house is an *eclectic* mixture of the antique and the modern.

An *innate* knowledge of right and wrong.

*Nomenclature* is a system of naming things, especially in science.

# Bioinformatics
In bioinformatics, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, or *BLAST*, is an
algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the
amino-acid sequences of different proteins or the nucleotides of DNA sequences. 

The *Smith-Waterman algorithm* is a well-known algorithm for performing local
sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two
*nucleotide* or protein sequences.

*Helicases* are a class of enzymes vital to all living organisms. They are motor
proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone,
separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-DNA
hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis.

*Primers*, which are short single strands of RNA, are synthesized by a protein
complex called *primase* and latch on to specific positions in the newly opened
strands, providing an anchor for the next step.

A DNA *polymerase*, a molecular machine, binds to each freshly separated
template strand of the DNA. DNA helicase separates strands, DNA polymerase
ensures proper complementarity of bases. 

Proteins form enzymes that perform biochemical reactions, send signals to other
cells, form the body's major components, like keratin in our skin.

They worked with the bread mold *Neurospora*, which can survive by consuming very
simple nutrients like *sucrose* and salt.
# OS
Floppy and hard disks for PCs are divided into 512 byte regions called
*sectors*.  A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity: each read or
write operation must be one or more sectors in size and aligned on a sector
boundary.

When you compile and link a C program, the compiler transforms each C source
('.c') file into an object ('.o') file containing assembly language instructions
encoded in the binary format expected by the hardware. The linker then combines
all of the compiled object files into a single binary image, which in this case
is a binary in the ELF format, which stands for "Executable and Linkable
Format".

Chargaff rule describes the adenine-to-thymine and guanine-to-cytosine
relationshhip in DNA.

Eukaryotic cells encapsulate their DNA in a nucleus and prokaryotics do not. All
multicellular organisms are eukaryotic while most unicellular organisms are
prokaryotics. 

# Enlisth
Our bodies constantly *metabolize* the food we eat.

The only existing treatment for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is bone
*marrow* transplantation. 

# Algorithm
Halting Problem cannot be solved by any computer.

Whether a 3-CNF (conjunctive normal form) is satisfiable is NPC. 

Stated in a way that has more relevance to NP-completeness, if we can provide
evidence that a decision problem is hard, we also provide evidence that its
related optimization problem is hard.
# English
Riley and Vasarely are two noteable artists who made contributions in the
illusory world of *op art*. A style with graphic abstraction and
pattern-oriented optical effects (mid-20th century). 

The boxer suffered from many blows in the *boxer ring*. 

*Ginseng* is a medicine made from the root of a Chinese plant, that some people
think keeps you young and healthy. 

A period of life characterized by physiological and psychic change that marks
the end of the reproductive capacity of women and terminates with the completion
of *menopause*. 

Squat is often used in negative sentences for emphasis. He had a job that
paid him *squat*.

The mother was all *on edge* when her son was having a blood test.

Contrary to Bill Clinton's claim that he never got special favors, his uncle
*pulled strings* and ran a "concerted lobbying campaign" that helped the
Democratic presidential candidate dodge the Vietnam draft, the Los Angeles Times
reported yesterday.

The other day when I was sitting in my basement with Nate and this female I had
to *third wheel* it. 

*High seas* are the open seas of the world outside the territorial waters of any
nation. 

# OS
## interrupts 
synchronous: caused by CPU (Divide by zero, System call, Bad pointer derefernce)
asynchronous: caused by an external event (device I/0, timer ticks)

## Intel nomenclature
Interrupt: asynchronous interrupts
Exception: synchronous interrupts

## x86 interrupts

interrupts types (0-255): 

* Type 0-31 are for processor interrupts, fixed by intel
* Type 13 general protection fault (An unauthorized int instruction) 
* Type 14 always for page faults
* Type 32-255 are software configured
* Type 32-47 are for device interrupts (IRQ) in JOS
* Type 0x80 interrupts for system call in Linux
* Control jump to kernel. Kernel code runs and handles the interrupt.
* The register state of the program (sometimes extra info in CPU registers E.g.,
page faults store the address that caused the fault in the cr2 register) is
dumped on the kernel's stack. 
* When handler completes, program resume (see iret instr.)

# Bioinformatics
The four letters of the DNA alphabet are adenine, thymine, guanine, and
cytosine. 

A gene is a DNA sequence which acts as a template for building a specific
protein.

The genome of a bacteria is typically about 1 million base pairs long.

Viruses are simplest organisms which require a living host. Its genome is about
10,000 base pairs long. 

The human genome is about 3 billion base pairs long. 

The homology between genes in different organisms is a natural consequence of
evolution. 

PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. 

Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by the lengths of DNA sequence based
on their movement speed in electrically charged Gel.
