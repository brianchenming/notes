# Bash
The ex command *:g/re/p* (grep) was the way they documented how to "globally"
"print" lines containing a "regular expression" (re). 

*:... g* is a prefix for "globally" applying a subsequent command to all lines
which match a pattern (regular expression) while *:... v* applies such a command
too all lines which do NOT match the given pattern ("v" from "conVerse").

Get machine type: arch; uname -a

Subshell hack:

    $ cmd0 | ( cmd1;cmd2;cmd3) | cmd4
    $ echo -e "Beijing Shanghai\n HongKong Chongqing" | ( while read wa wb; do echo "$wa to $wb"; done )
    Beijing to Shanghai
    HongKong to Chongqing

script and scriptreplay: record terminal sessions.

    $ script -t 2> timing.log -a output.session
    type commands;
    ...
    ...
    exit
    $ scriptreplay timing.log output.session

Bash process password

    #!/bin/sh
    #Filename: password.sh
    echo -e "Enter password: "
    stty -echo
    read password
    stty echo
    echo
    echo Password read.

Bash arrays

    $ array_var=(1 2 3 4 5 6)
    $ echo ${array_var[0]}
    $ echo ${array_var[*]}

    $ declare -A ass_array
    $ ass_array=([index1]=val1 [index2]=val2)

    $ declare -A fruits_value
    $ fruits_value=([apple]='100dollars' [orange]='150 dollars')
    $ echo "Apple costs ${fruits_value[apple]}"
    Apple costs 100 dollars

    $ declare -a MYRA
    $ MYRA=($(ls -ld DIR))

find: 

    $ find . \( -name "*.txt" -o -name "*.pdf" \) -print
    ./text.pdf
    ./new.txt
    $ find /home/users -path "*slynux*" -print
    /home/users/list/slynux.txt
    /home/users/slynux/eg.css
    $ find . -iregex ".*\(\.py\|\.sh\)$"
    ./test.py
    ./new.PY
    $ find . ! -name "*.txt" -print
    .
    ./next.jpg
    ./test.py
    ./new.PY
    $ find . -type f -user root -exec chown slynux {} \;
    $ find devel/source_path \( -name ".git" -prune \) -o \( -type f -print \)

xargs:

    $ cat cecho.sh
    #!/bin/bash -
    echo "$@ #"
    $ echo "arg1 arg2 arg3" | xargs -n 2 ./cecho.sh
    arg1 arg2 #
    arg3 #
    $ echo -e "arg1\n arg2\n arg3\n" | xargs -I {} ./cecho.sh -p {} -l
    -p arg1 -l #
    -p arg2 -l #
    -p arg3 -l #

Hence we must use -print0 along with find to produce an output with delimited
character null ('\0') whenever we use the find output as the xargs input.

    $ find . -type f -name "*.txt" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
    
*tput* and *stty* are utilities that can be used for terminal manipulations.

    tput sc     store the cursor position
    tput rc     restore cursor position
    tput ed     clear rest of current line

    {1..6} {a..z}
    `#!/bin/bash â€“xv`
    `:(){ :|:& };:`

A function can be exported like environment variables using export export -f fname
While using string comparison, it is best to use double square brackets since use of single
brackets can sometimes lead to errors. `[[ $str1 = $str2 ]]`

# sgid
The sgid permission for directory means that files created in it the directory
will inherit its group affiliation from the directory, rather than inheriting
it from user.

# make sync clock

This is a classic problem with VMs: it's hard to get an accurate clock when
it's virtual. If this happens, run the following command from time to time:

    /sbin/service ntpd restart

# shutdown server
Use -h option, which requests that the system be either halted or powered off
after it has been brought down, with the  choice  as to which left up to the
system.

    shutdown -h now 

# CentOS Compile New Kernel 
When compile new kernel from old version of CentOS, it is possible that the new
kernel complains about no hard drives found. To solve this, enable the
following two options in kernel config:

    CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y
    CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED_V2=y

# Ubuntu compile new kernel
After make menuconfig, make, make modules_install, and make install, also
update initramfs using

    $sudo update-initramfs -c -k 3.4.7 # substitute 3.4.7 with your version

# Find network card information

# Wajig
Wajig is a simplified wrapper to Debian's package management tools including
dpkg and APT. Wajig provides the functionality of apt-get, dpkg, dpkg-deb,
apt-cache and other tools. These tools launch as a subprocess. Wajig also
provides extra functionality beyond that of the stock apt and dpkg tools.  For
example, the command wajig sizes provides a listing of all installed packages
and the amount of disk space they require, from smallest to largest.
